Cross-Instance Isolation Tests

This module verifies data isolation between Feast Feature Store instances and
the Data Registry when they share the same Postgres SQL registry.

Setup:
    - credit-scoring (noAuth, project: credit_scoring_local)
    - driver-ranking  (noAuth, project: driver_ranking)
    - feast-auth      (kubernetes auth, project: feast_auth_project)
    - data-registry   (project: data_registry, protected via feast.dev/protected-project annotation)

All four CRs share one Postgres database as their SQL registry.  The tests
confirm that the protected-project annotation hides the data_registry project
from Feast project listings, and that the Data Registry's SAR-based auth
prevents it from exposing Feast-only projects.
